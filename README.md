## üöÄ About Me

üéì I am Ayoub ISSAAD, I'm an IT specialist, I love fixing things, solving problems and building interesting products. They say I'm a Cloud and DevOps engineer, but I don't shy away from getting my feet wet in many other domains, coding, system administration, cyber security, digital marketing and a little bit of design as well, You can say that I love to challenge myself and learn new things every now and then.

<!--üë®‚Äçüíª I enjoy contributing to **Open Source Projects** and am really enthusiastic about learning new technology. In 2020, I learnt **Django**, **Electron**, **Flutter**, **React** and **TypeScript**. In 2021 till now, I learnt **Next.js**, **SASS**, **Progressive Web App (PWA)** and a bit about **Three.js**. I also got started with [**freelancing**](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~01c12e516ee1d35044) and [**blogging**](https://dev.to/ruppysuppy) recently.-->

<!--üé∏ Outside the world of tech too, I love pushing myself to develop new skills ranging from **guitar**, **break dancing**, **sketching**, **touch typing** to some whacky ones like **writing with my left hand** (only aiming from mastery only in **guitar** and **dancing** though).-->

<!--‚úàÔ∏è I love **travelling** as well, even though its been some time since I last travelled. My last trip was a solo trip to **Bhutan** in _2018_.-->
